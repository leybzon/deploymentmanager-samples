Overview
========

Deployment of Portable Batch System (PBS) into the [shared VPC](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc) environment requires proper configuration of the host project VPC in addition to configuration of service project VPC. Deployment scripts in this project provision resources needed to support PBS in the host project. 

  
Deployment Prerequisites
========================

Before starting the deployment of PBS, set up the following:

1.  [Create Organization and VPC
    Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization)
    within that organization

2.  Designate Organization Admin and the owner of the project

3.  Setup a billing account in GCP

4.  Activate necessary APIs:

    1.  gcloud services enable deploymentmanager.googleapis.com

    2.  gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com

    3.  gcloud services enable servicemanagement.googleapis.com

5.  Define Cloud identities for users who need access to the cluster

6.  Identify [cloud service
    account](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-proj)
    that defines the identity of the nodes (by default in the form
    \<PROJECT-NUMBER\>\@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com e.g.
    116634650567\@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com)
6. Provision VPC in the host project as described in [Provisioning Shared VPC documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc)

Deployment Steps
================

1.  Update parameters of pbs-cluster-host.yaml file to match name of the shared VPC and region where VPC is deployed
2.  Run deployment manager command with pbs-cluster-host.yaml
